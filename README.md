This is a small project that I've inspired by Rock, Paper, Scissors base game combined with the game in "The Big Bang theory" series.
Easy rules: 
  - Scissors cuts Paper
  - Paper covers Rock
  - Rock crushes Lizard
  - Lizard poisons Spock
  - Spock smashes Scissors
  - Scissors decapitates Lizard
  - Lizard eats Paper
  - Paper desproves Spock
  - Spock vaporizes Rock
  - Rock crushes Scissors
